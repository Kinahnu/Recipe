        <ul>
           <li> So the only ingredients you'll need are a fresh slab of steak, salt, and pepper
           </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>So to begin you're going to want to oil a pan and leave it on medium high until it warms up </li>
            <li>Next you'll want to grab the steak and season then grab with tongs and sear all of the edges </li>
            <li>Once you've done that its time to set a 5 minute timer and lay it on its side </li>
            <li> once the timer goes off re-set it for 3 minutes and allow the other side to cook
                and then you're done! 
            </li>

        </ol>
